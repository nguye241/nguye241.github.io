                <p>I have lived in Vietnam for 17 years before moving to the US to now become a senior Design student at WWU. Initially, I had little idea of what to talk about for this section, but I decided to talk about my favorite video games.</p>
                <p>That being said, it's always a bit strange when people ask me "What do you think about -Name of a Trending TV show-?" considering how I'm more of a video game person than a "TV shows" person.</p>
                <p>But then again, that's not because I hate watching TV shows, I just prefer the feeling of being imerged into an open world video game, which (arguably) has really good writing, just like a really good book or TV show.</p>

                <h4>God of War</h4>
                <p>Released in 2018, God of War is the forth game in the amazing God of War franchise, now with a whole new look and the come back of director Cory Barlog - who was also the director for the first game God of War (2005) and God of War II (2007). The game shows the new journey moving from Greek to Norse mythogoly of the protagonist Kratos, in which he shows tremendous charater development throughout the years.

                <h4>Night In The Woods</h4>
                <p>Released in 2017, Night In The Woods is a story-focused exploration game which follows Mae Borrowski, who recently dropped out of college and has returned to her hometown - Possum Springs - to find out everything seems to have change as time goes on, without her. The game has an adorable artstyle with characters as different animals which serves as a nice mask for a more dark (?) and confusing story. The game also has incredible and relaxing soundtracks that I may or may not have been listening on loop on a daily basis.</p>

                <p>Released in 2020, Hades is a rogue-like video game that follows Zagreus - the son of the God of the Underworld Hades and the Goddess of Spring Persephone - as he tries to escape the Underworld and reach Mount Olympus, aided by many other Olympian Gods. Despite the grinding nature of it (which can be frustrating at times), the game balances it out with cool rewards and the charming visuals, voice-acting and story. The gatekeeper of the Underworld - Cerberus also makes a rather adorable appearance in the game.</p>

            <p>Over the course of his life, Kratos gradually gained immeasurable levels of superhuman strength, which seems to grow even greater during situations of great rage and anger. However, as he gradually continues with his tragic journey, Kratos grows older and wiser as he encounter different hardships along with his son Atreus, who plays a big role in helping Kratos' development as a character (and a father).</p>

He is aided and encouraged in his journey, primarily by his caretaker Nyx and his mentor Achilles. Others outside the House of Hades, such as Sisyphus, Charon, and the Olympians sometimes offer their aid as well.</p>
