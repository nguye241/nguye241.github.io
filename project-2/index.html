            <p>"Singularity" is a song by South Korean boy band BTS, sung as a solo by member V. It was released on May 7, 2018, as part of the album Love Yourself: Tear.</p>
            <p>Goldbin and Soohyoun Nam, writing for Mnews, described the setting of the music video as an enclosed space in which member V moves between areas of light and shadow, and, later, a dark room filled with flowers. They interpreted the "restrained" choreography, performed with white masks, as symbolising that he has concealed his true self to attain love, and the images of broken ice as indicating his realisation that he has been acting in a way that isn't genuine.</p>

            <p>Billboard stated that the video tied in with the other music videos of the "Love Yourself" era thematically and narratively. It draws on the importance of self-love with lyrics such as, "I'm the one I should love in this world/Shining me, this precious soul of mine/I finally realize/So I love me/Not so perfect but so beautiful.”</p>
